# Building-and-Deploying-Deep-Learning-Applications-with-TensorFlow
Excercise files working with TensorFlow 2.0 for the course on LinkedIn Learning.

As the course https://www.linkedin.com/learning/building-and-deploying-deep-learning-applications-with-tensorflow/ is referred to the old version of TensorFlow, I updated some excercise files capaple of working with TensorFlow 2.0 using **legacy options**.

You have to join the directories together with those provided by the course (linked to provided CSV files).
